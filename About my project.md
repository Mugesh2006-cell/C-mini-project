Project Name: Motion Detector Buzzer System

Description: This project uses a PIR motion sensor to detect movement and triggers a buzzer as an alert. The PIR sensor senses infrared radiation from moving objects and sends a signal to the Arduino. When motion is detected, the Arduino turns the buzzer ON; otherwise, it remains OFF. The system is simple and can be used for home security or intruder alert purposes. Components used include Arduino Uno, PIR sensor, buzzer, and jumper wires. It is implemented and tested in Tinkercad.
